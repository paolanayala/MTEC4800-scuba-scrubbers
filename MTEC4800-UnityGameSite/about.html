                <h1 class="about-heading"> Our Story</h1>
                    <p> We have developed an educational exploratorium that tackles the unrelenting pollution throughout New York City waterways. Playing as a passionate environmentalist, you take on the challenge of cleaning up the polluted waters of NYC. Armed with your scuba gear, you'll navigate the harbor, collecting debris and learning about the local flora and fauna along the way. </p>
                    <h1 class="about-heading"> Our Hero</h1>
                    <p> Our main character is Frankie, a native New Yorker with a love for the environment. Frankie would often spend weekends at Coney Island beach with his family as a kid, but grew concerned watching all the debris on the beach and water pile up over the years. Now that he's all grown up, he's on a mission to give back to his community by preserving its natural beauty for future generations of New Yorkers. </p>
