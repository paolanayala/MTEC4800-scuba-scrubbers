        <h2>Shaian Khan</h2>
        <h3>Programmer/Level Designer</h3>
        <p>My name is Shaian Khan. I am a video game developer & a filmmaker. I create video games & short films. Since my childhood I have
            always had the curiosity to learn how to make good movies and video games that I
            play and do all the creative stuff on the computer. I remember when I was 9 years
            old, I got my first computer as a gift from my parents. It's true that I was so excited
            for it but to be honest, back then I had no idea how to use a computer. I choose to
            learn about computers on my own and since then, I have been trying to learn new
            things on my computer every single day. One memory that I have in my mind
            when I use Photoshop on my computer for the first time to edit my own picture. I
            cropped my favorite superhero Spider-man's face and added my face on
            Spider-man's body. This was my first creative work on my own as a kid. It took me
            all day to figure out how to do this editing properly. This experience teaches me
            that if you have the desire to learn something creative, you must try on your own
            first. So, I can admit that my childhood curiosity and experience became my major
            influence to work on short films and video games. I also believe that doing proper
            research and taking essential academic courses are the plus points for enhancing
            the creative skills. Currently, I am studying Emerging Media Technology at City
            Tech. This major and all the creative stuff that I am learning in my academic career
            are going to enhance my creative skills and will be playing a major part in my
            professional career. </p>

        <p>Hey! My name is Seku (Say-coo) and I am from Queens, New York. I am currently studying video game design at New York City College of Technology. However, I am highly proficient in audio and video editing as well. As for my role in terms of this project, I was responsible for gathering and editing the audio files. Audio is very important when it comes to creating an immersive experience for someone to enjoy. Bad visuals are tolerable to a degree, but bad audio is not and will cause someone to disengage with your content almost immediately. Additionally, I was tasked with researching information about the underwater sea life that is prevalent within New York waters and creating the video game trailer.</p>

        <p>Hi my name is Kaitlyn, an emerging media technology student with a concentration in music technology, driven by my passion for the entertainment industry. My career goal is to become an audio engineer, with a primary focus on studio recording of music. However, my interests extend beyond music, I also aspire to work on movies or shows creating sound effects, recording lines for actors, and assisting with soundtracks. My interest and passion for sound design was able to be challenged by working on the class game project, where my partner and I successfully created an immersive audio experience for the game. Our roles included setting up sounds such as ambience, music for the beginning and ending, and creating sounds to depict the ocean life with animals.  The dedication to my craft, and expertise in sound design, made me a great asset to my team in the process of designing this game.</p>
